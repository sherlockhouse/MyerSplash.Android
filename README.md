## Introduction
Yet anothor simple and elegant photos & wallpaper app for all platforms.

Welcome to visit the [UWP](https://github.com/JuniperPhoton/MyerSplash.UWP) and [iOS](https://github.com/JuniperPhoton/MyerSplash.iOS) version :)

## Download

Visit the [website](https://juniperphoton.dev/myersplash/) to download all versions.

## Building

MyerSplash for Android is a standard Android gradle project. Just open it with Android Studio and see what will happen.

Welcome to use CLI to build the apk:

```
./gradlew clean :app:assembleDebug
```

Note that in order to access the unsplash API, you must:

- Register as developer in unsplash.com
- Copy your app secret key

Then in your `local.properties`:

```
unsplashKey=xxxx
appcenterKey=xxx
```

This app uses Microsoft's AppCenter to do the analysis, thus you should also have the appcenterKey too.
